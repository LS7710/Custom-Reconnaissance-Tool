With a single URL input, the tool performs the following checks:

- **Ping Check** â€” Check if the Domain is up and running
- **Server Headers** â€” Detects what server the site is running on
- **robots.txt Check** â€” Reads disallowed paths for possible information gathering
- **Hidden Page Brute Force** â€” Finds pages like `/admin`, `/backup`, etc.
- **Form Scanner** â€” Lists all `<form>` actions and methods (XSS, SQLi target indicators)
- **IDOR Fuzzer** â€” Searches common parameter names for possible insecure object access
- **Sensitive File Scanner** â€” Tries to find unsecured files `.env`, `.git/`, `backup.zip`
